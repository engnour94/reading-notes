# Authentication

### Questions

1. **Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)**

the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.

2. **Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes**

We can use it to create classes that we need it to be instantiating only once, for example to create no more than one user in the application by accident.

>class Singleton {
  constructor() {
    if (Singleton.instance === null) {
      this.property = [];
      Singleton.instance = this;
    }
    return Singleton.instance;
  }
}
const instance = new Singleton();
Object.freeze(instance);
>export default instance;

3. **If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?**

  *  create that middleware (function) in a separate file for modularity purposes
  * require it (import it) in the desired file
  * if the middleware is to be used globally on all  routes, that can be achieved with app.use(middlewareName). 
  * if it is meant for certain routes, it can be added in them as an argument as such app.get('/route', middlewareName, handleRoute)

### Documentations

* **Router Middleware** : Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. For an introduction to routing, see Basic routing.

* **Dynamic Module Loading** : It is an approach where modules are loaded on demand (when needed)this is also called lazy loading. another use case is dynamically loading modules based on conditions (computed module specifier strings).

* **CRUD -> REST Method Matches**:
In computer programming, create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) are the four basic operations of persistent storage. Alternate words are sometimes used when defining the four basic operations of CRUD, such as construct instead of create, retrieve instead of read, or destroy or destruct instead of delete. CRUD is also sometimes used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information, often using computer-based forms and reports. The term was likely first popularized by James Martin in his 1983 book Managing the Data-base environment. The acronym may be extended to CRUDL to cover listing of large data sets which bring additional complexity such as pagination when the data sets are too large to be easily held in memory

* **Mock Testing** : The process of mocking the module or app you want to test by using different node packages, for example you can mock the whole app server by using supertest dependency, or you can mock the MongoDB by using supergoose dependency.

### Preparation Materials 


#### Securing Passwords

* Authentication: process of verifying than an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be
* Session management: process by which a server maintains the state of an entity interacting with it
User IDs: make sure usernames/userIDs are case-insensitive
* Passwords: minimum length of 8 characters, common maximum length is 64 characters
* Transmit passwords only over TLS (transport layer protection) or other strong transport
* Require re-authentication for sensitive features
* Account lockout: prevent any more login attempts after a series of failed logins 



**Securing Passwords with Bcrypt Hashing Function**

Hashing is the greatest way for protecting passwords and considered to be pretty safe for ensuring the integrity of data or password.

Bcrypt is an adaptive hash function based on the Blowfish symmetric block cipher cryptographic algorithm and introduces a work factor (also known as security factor), which allows you to determine how expensive the hash function will be

#### Basic Auth

basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request. In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of Authorization: Basic <credentials>. Authentications are encoded. we use .set() to pass the authentications to the HTTP header request.

Authentication: is the process of verifying that an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be. Authentication in the context of web applications is commonly performed by submitting a username or ID and one or more items of private information that only a given user should know.

**Authentication**:
 is the process of verifying that an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be. Authentication in the context of web applications is commonly performed by submitting a username or ID and one or more items of private information that only a given user should know.

**Session Management** :
 is a process by which a server maintains the state of an entity interacting with it. This is required for a server to remember how to react to subsequent requests throughout a transaction. Sessions are maintained on the server by a session identifier which can be passed back and forward between the client and server when transmitting and receiving requests. Sessions should be unique per user and computationally very difficult to predict. The Session Management Cheat Sheet contains further guidance on the best practices in this area.

#### bcrypt docs

To install Bcrypt Package `npm install bcrypt`
Bcrypt is an adaptive hash function based on the Blowfish symmetric block cipher cryptographic algorithm and introduces a work factor (also known as security factor), which allows you to determine how expensive the hash function will be. This work factor value determines how slow the hash function will be, means different work factor will generate different hash values in different time span, which makes it extremely resistant to brute force attacks. When computers become faster next year we can increase the work factor to balance it out i.e. to make the attack slower.
