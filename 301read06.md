## What Is Node.js?
* Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
* Node.js is an open source server environment
* Node.js is free
* Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
* Node.js uses JavaScript on the server

# Why Node.js?
Node.js uses asynchronous programming!

A common task for a web server can be to open a file on the server and return the content to the client.

Here is how PHP or ASP handles a file request:

1. Sends the task to the computer's file system.
2. Waits while the file system opens and reads the file.
3. Returns the content to the client.
4. Ready to handle the next request.

Here is how Node.js handles a file request:

1. Sends the task to the computer's file system.
2. Ready to handle the next request.
3. When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.

Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.
## What Can Node.js Do?

* Node.js can generate dynamic page content
* Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
* Node.js can collect form data
* Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database

## What is a Node.js File?
* Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events
* A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server
* Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect
* Node.js files have extension ".js"

## Are There Any Downsides?
The fact that Node runs in a single thread does impose some limitations. For example, blocking I/O calls should be avoided, CPU-intensive operations should be handed off to a worker thread, and errors should always be handled correctly for fear of crashing the entire process.

Some developers also dislike the callback-based style of coding that JavaScript imposes (so much so that there’s even a site dedicated to the horrors of writing asynchronous JavaScript). But with the arrival of native Promises, followed closely by async await, flow control in modern JavaScript has become easier than it ever was.
