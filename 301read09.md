# Functional Programming
## Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript
### What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data 
### Pure functions
* Pure functions has a very strict definition of purity.
* It returns the same result if given the same arguments (aka deterministic);
* An impure function would receive "radius" as the parameter, and then calculate "radius * radius * PI": This is impure because it uses a global object that was not passed as a parameter to the function. We would always pass "PI" value as a parameter to the function, so now we are just accessing parameters passed to the function. No external object
* Reading Files if our function reads external files, it is not pure. The file's contents can change.
* Random number generation: Any function that relies on a random number generator cannot be pure.
It does not cause any observable side effects: examples of observable side effects include modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference.
* Mutability is discouraged in functional programming
* Pure functions are stable, consistent and predictable. Given the same parameters, pure functions will alway return the same result.
* Pure function benefits: The code is easier to test, we don't have to mock anything. We can unit test pure functions with different contexts:
Given a parameter "A" => expect the function to return value "B"
* Given a paramter "C" => expect the function to return value "D"
* A function to receive a collection of numbers and expect it to increment each element of this collection.

### Immutability
When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.
In Javascript we commonly use the for loop. This next for statement has some mutable variables.

### Higher-order functions
When we talk about higher-order functions, we mean a function that either:
takes one or more functions as arguments, or
returns a function as its result
The doubleOperator function we implemented above is a higher-order function because it takes an operator function as an argument and uses it.
You’ve probably already heard about filter, map, and reduce. Let's take a look at these.

### Referential transparency:
A "square function" (aka pure function) will always have the same output, given the same input. Passinng 2 as a parameter of the square function will always return 4. We replace it with square(2) and now the function becomes referentially transparen
