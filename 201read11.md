## Images
### Controlling size of images in CSS

The width attribute specifies the width of an image, in pixels.

Tip: Always specify both the height and width attributes for images. If height and width are set, the space required for the image is reserved when the page is loaded. However, without these attributes, the browser does not know the size of the image, and cannot reserve the appropriate space to it. The effect will be that the page layout will change during loading (while the images load).

### Aligning images in CSS
float property is commonly used to align images.

images by default are inline elements that flow within the surrounding text.

for images to be centered they must be turned into block level elements using the display property.

### Background Images

The background-image property sets one or more background images for an element.

By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.

Tip: The background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin).
