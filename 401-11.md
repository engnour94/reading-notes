# Event Driven Applications

## Review, Research, and Discussion


1. Why is access control important?

Access control is important because it is a valuable security technique that can be used to regulate who or what can view or use any given resource.

2. Describe an application that would need access control.
 application for Online schools, where the instructors have access to all students data, grading logs, and many other things whereas the students can't access all logs or change data related to the courses.

3. What is a role used for?
A role is used to determine what type of capabilities a user has. Administrators for example have all capabilities (read, write, update, delete), while a regular user may only have read capabilities

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

For most business applications, RBAC is superior to ACL in terms of security and administrative overhead. ACL is better suited for implementing security at the individual user level and for low-level data, while RBAC better serves a company-wide security system with an overseeing administrator

## Vocabulary Terms

* **Authorization** : process of giving the user permission to access a specific resource or function (access control or client privilege), in secure environments authorization must follow authentication

* **Role Based Access Control** : is the process of giving the users different access over the app data and recourses based on their ROLE in the company of organization.

* **Capabilities**: is the ability to perform or achieve certain actions or outcomes

## Preparation Materials

**Event-Driven Programming** : is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision. In this article weâ€™re going to go over how Event-Driven Programming works and how we can make the best use of it in our Node.js projects.

**Event-Driven Programming makes use of the following concepts** :

- An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered.
* A Main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.

**EventEmitter**: is a module provides from node.js allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away.

**Event listeners** :A main loop that listens to an event emitter and calls the event handlers.

**Event Handlers**:  is a call back function the run when an event been triggered.

* Removing listeners with `removeListener` or `removeAllListeners`

* Must pass reference to the exact function you wish to remove when using the removeListener method, which means wherever you want to remove the event you need to make sure the function is able to be referenced from that place in your code (often best to name the event handling function and declare them before you register the event listener as opposed to leaving them anonymous)

* **Node.js : Events**
  * Passing arguments and this to listeners
  * synchronous vs. synchronous
  * Handling events only once
  * Error events
  * Capture rejections of promises
  * Class: EventEmitter
  * Class: EventTarget
  * Class: NodeEventTarget
