#  Routing

## Q

1. **Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?**
<br>
yes
1. **When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?**
```
<Main>
  <Content />
</Main>
```
<br>
when the condition met then use props.children which will render all the wrapped children inside of it.

1. **Can a component, such as `<Content />`, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?**
<br>
yes

1. **What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children**
<br>
yes by using `<ChildComponent {...props}>`

## Terms

* **props.children**: The React docs say that you can use props.children on components that represent ‘generic boxes’ and that ‘don’t know their children ahead of time’. For me, that didn’t really clear things up. I’m sure for some, that definition makes perfect sense but it didn’t for me.
My simple explanation of what this.props.children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.

* **composition**: the act of combining parts or elements to form a whole, components are the UI building blocks in React applications like pure functions are the building blocks of function composition

## Preparation Materials

**Routes**

The `<Route>` component is the main building block of React Router. Anywhere that you want to only render content based on the location’s pathname, you should use a `<Route>` element.

**Creating our routes**
`<Route>`s can be created anywhere inside of the router, but often it makes sense to render them in the same place. You can use the `<Switch>` component to group` <Route>s`. The `<Switch>` will iterate over its children elements (the routes) and only render the first one that matches the current pathname.

**What does the `<Route> `render?**


Routes have three props that can be used to define what should be rendered when the route’s path matches. Only one should be provided to a <Route> element.

* component — A React component. When a route with a component prop matches, the route will return a new element whose type is the provided React component (created using React.createElement).
* render — A function that returns a React element 5. It will be called when the path matches. This is similar to component, but is useful for inline rendering and passing extra props to the element.
* children — A function that returns a React element. Unlike the prior two props, this will always be rendered, regardless of whether the route’s path matches the current location.

## Hooks

React Router ships with a few hooks that let you access the state of the router and perform navigation from inside your components.

### useHistory
The useHistory hook gives you access to the history instance that you may use to navigate.

### useLocation

The useLocation hook returns the location object that represents the current URL. You can think about it like a useState that returns a new location whenever the URL changes.

### useRouteMatch
The useRouteMatch hook attempts to match the current URL in the same way that a `<Route>` would. It’s mostly useful for getting access to the match data without actually rendering a `<Route>`.
