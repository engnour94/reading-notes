# Javascript Templating
* JS Templating:
a technique used to render client-side view templates (which are HTML markup, with added templating tags) with JS by using a JSON data source

* Template Engine:
replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client

* Mustache:
Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.
It is often referred to as “logic-less” because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags. Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values.
mustache.js is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript. It is often considered the base for JavaScript templating. And, since mustache supports various languages, we don’t need a separate templating system on the server side

## Flexbox
The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities. This article gives an outline of the main features of flexbox, which we will be exploring in more detail in the rest of these guides.

When we describe flexbox as being one dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time — either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the two-dimensional model of CSS Grid Layout, which controls columns and rows together.
## The two axes of flexbox
When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes — the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it. Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work from the outset

## flexbox axis
The main axis is defined by flex-direction, which has four possible values:

* row
* row-reverse
* column
* column-reverse
 Should you choose row or row-reverse, your main axis will run along the row in the inline direction.

Choose column or column-reverse and your main axis will run from the top of the page to the bottom — in the block direction.

### Flexbox Layout
* Flexbox Layout provides a way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container efficiently, even when their sizes are dynamic

* It gives the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space

* Flexbox layout is more flexible that other layouts because it's independent of direction (vertical-base and horizontal-base)

* Flexbox layout is most appropriate for small-scale layouts, while Grid layout is for large-scale layouts

### Flexbox Basics

* Flexbox is a CSS module including a set of properties

* flex container is a parent element, which the flebox properties are set on

* flex items are children elements which flexbox properties are set on

* flex layout is based on flex-flow directions, rather than on block and inline flow directions as regular layout

### Flexbox container
An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called a flex container. To create a flex container, we set the value of the area's container's display property to flex or inline-flex. As soon as we do this the direct children of that container become flex items. As with all properties in CSS, some initial values are defined, so when creating a flex container all of the contained flex items will behave in the following way.

* Items display in a row (the flex-direction property's default is row).
* The items start from the start edge of the main axis.
* The items do not stretch on the main dimension, but can shrink.
* The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross axis.
* The flex-basis property is set to auto.
* The flex-wrap property is set to nowrap

### Properties used with the flex container:

* display
* flex-direction
* flex-wrap
* flex-flow
* align-content
* align-items
  * stretch
   * flex-start
   * flex-end
    * center
### Properties used with the flex items:
* order
* flex-grow
* flex-shrink
* flex-basis
* flex
* align-self and information about each one

## justify-content
The justify-content property is used to align the items on the main axis, the direction in which flex-direction has set the flow. The initial value is flex-start which will line the items up at the start edge of the container, but you could also set the value to flex-end to line them up at the end, or center to line them up in the centre.
* flex-start
* flex-end
* center
* space-around
* space-between
* space-evenly
