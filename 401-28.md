## Q

1. **Why is the Context API useful?** to pass the data (states or others) from parent to all the children without the need of props
1. **Can a component outside of a provider get its context?**
No
1. **What are some common use cases for using the Context API?**
 pass functions that need to be available in multiple places.such as currently authenticated user, or theme settings for the application.


1. **Describe “Context Hell”**:

## Terms

 * **global state**: Keeping a state at the top level of an application and providing access methods to all child levels without the need to pass props. Global state should only keep states that concern the entire app, such as theme, language, or other app-wide settings.

 * **global context**  context that is passed from the app.js component and is available to all child components
 * **provider**: Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes. Provider component accepts a value prop to be passed to consuming components that are descendants of this Provider. One Provider can be connected to many consumers. Providers can be nested to override values deeper within the tree.

 * **consumer** A component (child) that can read the state from the provider

### DEFINITION OF ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC)
also known as role-based security, is a mechanism that restricts system access. It involves setting permissions and privileges to enable access to authorized users. Most large organizations use role-based access control to provide their employees with varying levels of access based on their roles and responsibilities. This protects sensitive data and ensures employees can only access information and perform actions they need to do their jobs.

### Benefits of RBAC:
* Reducing administrative work and IT support.
* Maximizing operational efficiency.
* Improving compliance.

### EXAMPLES OF ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL
* Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
* Management role group – you can add and remove members.
* Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
* Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group
