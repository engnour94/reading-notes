# Chart.js, Canvas


##  Chart.js 
Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

A great way to get started with charts is with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.

The great things about Chart.js are that it’s simple to use and really very flexible. Plus, once you’ve mastered the basics here, you’ll discover that there are tons of options listed in the documentation.

**Creating a Chart**
It's easy to get started with Chart.js. All that's required is the script included in your page along with a single `<canvas>` node to render the chart.

## What is HTML Canvas?
The HTML `<canvas>` element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.

The `<canvas>` element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.

Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

The `<canvas>` element
`<canvas>` element is similler to `<img>` element

`<canvas>` HTML element has two attributes (which are optional):

* width initial value if not specified : 300px
* height** initial value if not specified : 150px
the `<canvas>` element can be styled with CSS like other images using the styling rules : margin , border, background , etc

when no styling rules are applied to the `<canvas> `it will initially be fully transparent

### Draw on the Canvas
All drawing on the HTML canvas must be done with JavaScript

Step 1: Find the Canvas Element

Step 2: Create a Drawing Object

Step 3: Draw on the Canvas

##  Drawing shapes with canvas
**The Grid**
The grid is the coordinate space of canvas

* 1 unit in the grid corresponds to 1 pixel on the canvas
* all elements are placed relative to the origin
**`<canvas>` only supports two primitive shapes:**
* rectangles
* paths (lists of points connected by lines)
other shapes must be created by combining one or more paths

**Drawing Rectangles**
There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas:

1. fillRect(x, y, width, height) Draws a filled rectangle
2. strokeRect(x, y, width, height) Draws a rectangular outline
3. clearRect(x, y, width, height) Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent
The parameters:
x and y specify the position on the canvas (relative to the origin)
width and height provide the rectangle's size
