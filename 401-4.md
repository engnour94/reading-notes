# Data Modeling

### Questions

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

- TDD reduces the time required for project development
- Makes code easier to refactor and catch bugs.
- Improved design qualities in code

2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

- Use beforeEach() if a method needs to be called before a test is run
- Use afterEach() if you need to reset the environment after a test has run

3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
 - Might be a slow process
 - Tests show the presence of bugs in the code
- Tests change when the requirements of the features change
- not running tests frequently enough or writing too many tests at once

4. What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

“A prototype is a working object instance. Objects inherit directly from other objects.” “Classes inherit from classes and create subclass relationships: hierarchical class taxonomies.”

In classes each method will be defined as a prototype, meaning when you make instance of that class the prototype will not take from memory and will not be there unless you call it in the instance, whereas in constructors each method you define in it, and make new instance all the methods will be there and will take from the memory even if you do not call them.


5. Why REST?
- Maintain, more readable, more scalable (stateless and faster data interchange
- Makes your Application More Scalable.
- Caching is Easier with REST.
- Flexible.

### Documentation

**functional programming** :is the programming process that compose pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.

**object-oriented programming (OOP)**:It is the most popular programming paradigm and is taught as the standard way to code... it relies on the concept of classes and objects... classes can contain functions (methods)... and classes can be inherited in subclasses, saving time and space in writing repeated code unnecessarily.

**class**:templates for creating objects. The constructor() method is used for creating and initializing an object created with a class. Can only be one constructor() per class

**this**: In the global context, it refers to the global object (window)... inside classes, it refers to the object it belongs to... inside events, it refers to the element that received the event...

**Test Driven Development (TDD)**: is the act of first deciding what you want your program to do (the specifications), formulating a failing test, then writing the code to make that test pass.

**jest**: JavaScript Testing Framework; Jest runs previously failed tests first and reorganizes runs based on how long test files take

**Continuous Integration (CI)**:CI is a work flow strategy to ensure everyone's changing (new codes) will integrate to the main brach (help to reduce merge conflicts and catch bugs) and it does that by using webhooks or APIs that will take each commit and test it and back to you with a message weather passed or not.

**REST**:Stands for Representational State Transfer. in simple terms, it is an architectural style that advocates that web applications should use HTTP methods to hang out with each other (communicate), aka (getting, creating, mutating data etc etc).

**Data Model**:  Data model is a diagram that illustrates relationships and behaviors of different pieces of an application and how those pieces depend on one another

### Preparation Materials

**nosql vs sql**:


*  SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
* SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. * This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.
* SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
* SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.

**NoSQL Modeling Techniques**:

* Often compared by various non-functional criteria, such as scalability, performance, and consistency
* Often starts from the application-specific queries as opposed to relational modeling
* Often requires a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms than relational database modeling does
* Data duplication and denormalization are first class citizens
