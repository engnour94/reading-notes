# What Google Learned About Teams
The key characteristics of 'enhanced teams'
 Google found that the kinds of people (a.k.a. the individual personalities) in a team are not so relevant.

the researchers found that there were five key characteristics of enhanced teams:

* **Psychological safety:** Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won't be embarrassed or punished for doing so.
* **Dependability:** Everyone completes quality work on time.
* **Structure and clarity:** Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.
* **Meaning:** Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).
* **Impact:** Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization's overall goals.

## How I explained REST to my brother
* Roy Fielding; helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet, then proceeded to do a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

* The web, also "HTTP" first tells the browser what protocol to use. All of the stuff you in type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing. It is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It is the literal foundation of the web, think of it like a GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

* The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called "REST". REST provides a definition of a "resource", which is what those things point to.

* A web page is a "representation" of a resource. Resources are just concepts, URLS. URLS tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.

* Other types of representation: It doesn't get used a lot, in most cases a resource has only a single representation.

* Concepts also known as "Web Services" or "APIs". It means a lot of different things to a lot of different people but the basic concept is that machines could use the web just like people do.
Computers can use same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other.
