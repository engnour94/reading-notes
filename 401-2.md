#### What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?

The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.

#### Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

 this point connects Swagger and APIDoc.js in a comparison with their behavior regarding status error codes... they should be two separate points... anyway, for error codes
 Swagger allows you to describe the structure of your APIs so that machines can read them. and it gives the API the ability to describe it's own structure so you can automatically build API documentation.

APIDoc.js : allow you to create documentation for your API in the source code. these are the required info to document your API:

to install APIDOC = npm install apidoc -g /**

 **Swagger**
* 200: OK
*  400: Bad request. User ID must be an integer and larger than 0.
* 401: Authorization information is missing or invalid.
* 404: A user with the specified ID was not found.
* 5XX: Unexpected error.

**APIDoc**  
* 200: Ok
* 400: Bad Request
* 401: Not Authenticated
* 404: Not found
* 4xx: Errors


#### Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

**REST** stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a software architecture style that relies on a stateless communications protocol, most commonly, HTTP. REST structures data in XML, YAML, or any other format that is machine-readable, but usually JSON is most widely used. REST follows the object-oriented programming paradigm of noun-verb. REST is very data-driven, compared to SOAP, which is strongly function-driven.

**SOAP**  Simple Object Access Protocol – is probably the better known of the two models.SOAP relies heavily on XML, and together with schemas, defines a very strongly typed messaging framework. Every operation the service provides is explicitly defined, along with the XML structure of the request and response for that operation. Each input parameter is similarly defined and bound to a type: for example an integer, a string, or some other complex object.

#### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**Web Server:**  A web server is a software that uses HTTP and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users.

**Express:** It is the most popular Node.js web framework... it provides the ability to create routes and handlers, backend rendering and the use of middlewares to do all sorts of sweet stuff.

**Routing:** Routing defines the way in which the client requests are handled by the application endpoints. source

**WRRC:** It is strange how hard it is to find the meaning of the WRRC acronym on the web, even though I know it is the Web Request Response Cycle... as the name suggests, it is the cycle of HTTP requests (get, post...) and the responses to them.

#### extra definition 

NPM: Node Package Manager, a subsidiary of GitHub. It is the world's largest software registry its registry is a public database of JavaScript software,using the CLI, a human being, aka programmer, can install packages and tools to be used in ways unimaginable to non-programming human beings.

##### npm consists of three distinct components:
* the website
* the Command Line Interface (CLI)
* the registry


##### What is TDD?

“Test-driven development” refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests) and design (in the form of refactoring).

It can be succinctly described by the following set of rules:

write a “single” unit test describing an aspect of the program
run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature
write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass
“refactor” the code until it conforms to the simplicity criteria
repeat, “accumulating” unit tests over time

##### (CI / CD) 

(CI / CD) Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery : CI is a work flow strategy to ensure everyone's changing (new codes) will integrate to the main brach (help to reduce merge conflicts and catch bugs) and it does that by using webhooks or APIs that will take each commit and test it and back to you with a message weather passed or not.
