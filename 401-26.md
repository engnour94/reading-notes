# Custom Hooks

1. **What does a component’s lifecycle refer to?**
 mounting, updating and unmounting

2. **Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in `useCallback` when called from within `useEffect`**

`useCallback()` is often used in conjunction with `useEffect() ` because it allows you to prevent the re-creation of a function.

2. **Why are functional components preferred over class components?**

      1.  it save time because you don't have to think about the type of the component, will it be a class, functional, stateless.  You just start with a function. 

    2. functional components make for cleaner and Dryer code

3. **What is wrong with the following code?**

```
import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function changeCount(e) {
    setCount(e.target.value);
  }

  let renderedItems = []

  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    useEffect( () => {
      console.log('component mount/update');
    }, [count]);

    renderedItems.push(<div key={i}>Item</div>);
  }

  return (<div>
     <input type='number' value={count} onChange={changeCount}/>
      {renderedItems}
    </div>);
}
```
useEffect is used in the  loop, and it's not at the top level of the function

## Terms

* **state hook** :`useState()`, similar to `this.setState()` in a class except it doesn't merge the old and new state together. The only argument to `useState()` is the initial state. Allows us to add a state powered variable to our application.

* **effect hook**  `useEffect()`, adds the ability to perform side effects (data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM from React components) from a function component. Serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes but unified into a single API. Allows us to define properties that will trigger or not trigger React API features.

* **reducer hook** is a hook I use sometimes to manage the state of the application, It acts as an alternate hook to the useState hook to manage complex state in your application.

#### **So How Do We Use Hooks**
The easiest way to describe Hooks is to show side-by-side examples of a class component that needs to have access to state and lifecycle methods, and another example where we achieve the same thing with a functional component.

Below I provide a working example similar to those in the ReactJS docs, but one that you can touch and play around with, getting your hands dirty with a StackBlitz demo for each stage of our learning. So let's stop talking and start learning about React Hooks.


#### The Benefits of Using Hooks

Hooks have a lot of benefit to us as developers, and they are going to change the way we write components for the better. They already help us to write clearer and more concise code - it's like we went on a code diet and we lost a lot of weight and we look better and feel better. It brings out our jawline and makes us feel lighter on our toes. It's the one change that works for us. Just look at what React Hooks have done for others!


#### useReducer

An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method. (If you’re familiar with Redux, you already know how this works.)
useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.
