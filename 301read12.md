# EJS Partials
* handy for reusing the same HTML across multiple views. (ie footers, menus and navs)
* best practice to include a partials directory in the views directory - the partial you want to re-use is stored in its own file (i.e navbar.ejs for a nav bar used across your site)
another good example use case is footer.ejs

* Partials can be thought of like functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you won't hvae to go and change a piece of text in every page it is in. In place, you define the reusable bundle of code in a file and include it wherever you need it
* In EJS, any JS or non-HTML syntax you include in your templates is always surrounded by <% %> delimeters
* Including a partial in EJS you use <%- include(PARTIAL_FILE) %> where the partial file is relative to the template you use it in.
* NOTE The <% %> tags allow you to output the unescaped content onto the page (mind the -). It is important when using the include() statement since you won't want EJS to escape your HTML characters like '<', '>', etc.
* creating and including partials is very straightforward with EJS, you just have to create the partial files for HTML pieces that you want to reuse, and then just include them in other pages using the syntax.


## from video
* code: <%- include('partials/onepartial;) %>
* Take not of the single "-" in the code above
* Includes the particular ejs file
* Go to views, new folder = partials
* Create file within partials folder, "one-partial.ejs"
* Within ejs file type some proof of life
* The above steps help to use reusable text
