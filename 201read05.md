# HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

## Image 
Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.

### Adding Images

HTML Images Syntax
The HTML `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The `<img>` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The `<img>` tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The `<img>` tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image

**Syntax**
`<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">`

### Height & Width of Images
You will also often see an `<img>` element use two other attributes that specify its size:
**height**
This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
**width**
This specifies the width of the image in pixels.

e.g
` <img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of
 quokka" width="600" height="450" />`

 ### HTML5: Figure and Figure Caption

 `<figure>`
Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new `<figure>` element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated.
You can have more than one image inside the `<figure>` element as long as they all share
the same caption.

### Summary images

*  The `<img>` element is used to add images to a
web page.
* You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.
* You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
* Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.



## Color

### Foreground Color
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:

* rgb values
These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)

 * hex codes
These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #sign. For example: #ee3e80

* color names
There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan

<br>
```
/* color name */
h1 {
color: DarkCyan;}
/* hex code */
h2 {
color: #ee3e80;}
/* rgb value */
p {
color: rgb(100,100,90);}
```

### Background Color
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.

>body {
background-color: rgb(200,200,200);}
h1 {
background-color: DarkCyan;}
h2 {
background-color: #ee3e80;}
p {
background-color: white;}

### Summery COLOR
*  Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
* There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
* Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
*  It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
* CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.


## Text



### Headings and paragraphs
* **Headings**
HTML has six "levels" of headings
E.g:
`<h5>This is a Level 5 Heading</h5>`
<h5>This is a Level 5 Heading</h5>

* **Paragraphs**
To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening `<p>` tag and closing `</p>` tag.


### Bold, italic, emphasis

* **Bold**

By enclosing words in the tags `<b>` and `</b>` we can make characters appear bold.
The `<b>` element also represents a section of text that would be presented in a visually different way (for example key words in a paragraph) although the use of the `<b> `element does not imply
any additional meaning.

* **Italic**
`<i>`
By enclosing words in the tags `<i>` and `</i>` we can make characters appear italic.
The `<i>` element also represents a section of text that would be said in a different way from surrounding content — such as technical terms, names of ships, foreign words, thoughts, or other terms that would usually be italicized.

<br>

* **Superscript & Subscrip**

`<sup>`
The `<sup>` element is used to contain characters that
should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power 

`<sub>`

The `<sub>` element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas .
E.g:
`<p>On the 4<sup>th</sup> of September you will learn about E=MC<sup>2</sup>.</p>`
`<p>The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere grew by 2ppm in 2009<sub>1</sub>.</p>`

result:
<p>On the 4<sup>th</sup> of September you will learn
 about E=MC<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere
 grew by 2ppm in 2009<sub>1</sub>.</p>

 * **White Space**
 In order to make code easier to read, web page authors often add extra spaces or start some elements on new lines. When the browser comes across
two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space.
Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as white space collapsing.


* **Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules**

`<br />`
As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line. But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can
use the line break tag `<br />`.

`<hr />`
To create a break between
themes — such as a change of
topic in a book or a new scene
in a play — you can add a
horizontal rule between sections
using the `<hr />` tag.
