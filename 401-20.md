# Component Based UI

## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. **Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)**
* Vue.js
* Angular
* Ext JS by Sencha
* Ember
* Svelte 3

1. **What’s the difference between a framework and a library?**
the main difference is in Inversion of control: makes the dependency for the library inside framework and passes it when  need it, the framework provides the necessary components to the library to work,
The framework contains libraries and  is not built in the library 
For example, you cant find the calculator function in the framework but it  gives the tool to create it but you can find a library for this

## Terms

* **Rendering**:Rendering is a process used in web development that turns website code into the interactive pages users see when they visit a website. in react( render a React element into a root DOM node)
* **Templates**:Templating refers to the client side data binding method implemented with the JavaScript language. Popular JavaScript templating languages are: AngularJS, Backbone.js, Ember.js, Handlebars.js, and Mustache.js. The templating engine is responsible for connecting to the data model, processing the code specified in the source templates, and directing the output to a specific pipeline, text file, or stream.
* **State**: JS object/private feature belongs to single component and holds its data/ it can be changed using setState()/similar to variables that declare inside function/managed and limited the component

## Preparation Materials
### what is React js?
- library for building flexible  user interface
- single page application
- represents V in MVC
### Concepts of React?
- **components**: Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. 
Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
- **JSX**: 
    *  JSX stands for JavaScript XML.

    * JSX allows us to write HTML in React.

     * JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

- **Virtual DOM**



### SASS - Nesting and Variables
SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets, it is an extension to CSS. It comes with lots of exciting features such as variables, nesting, mixins, inline imports, built-in functions to manipulate color and other values amongst others.
**Nesting** is the process of placing selectors inside the scope of another selector (CSS selectors are used to select the content you want to style. Selectors are the part of CSS rule set. CSS selectors select HTML elements according to its id, class, type, attribute etc.).

In SASS **variables** are use to store reusable value for properties across your style sheet. Although this feature isn't unique to SASS (as it was recently added to standard CSS), the method of declaration and use still vary.
Variables in SASS allow you to assign an identifier of your choice to a specific value. Usually this achieved using the dollar sign ($) followed by the name of your identifier, that is $my_unique_identifier .
