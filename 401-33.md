#  Redux - Additional Topics

## Q

1. **What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?**
- Assign an empty object or array to the initial state
- Can use a useEffect() hook to load data on application start.
1. **When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?**

 export async function then dispatch the action

## Terms

* **middleware**: Software or code that acts as a middle man... and performs a necessary handle on the data before reaching its next destination
* **thunk** library in redux use to delay the action



## Preparation Materials

### Redux Toolkit

#### Purpose
The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

1. "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
2. "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
3. "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"

#### advantages 
1. **Simple**
Includes utilities to simplify common use cases like store setup, creating reducers, immutable update logic, and more.

2. **Opinionated**
Provides good defaults for store setup out of the box, and includes the most commonly used Redux addons built-in.
3. **Powerful**
Takes inspiration from libraries like Immer and Autodux to let you write "mutative" immutable update logic, and even create entire "slices" of state automatically.

4. **Effective**
Lets you focus on the core logic your app needs, so you can do more work with less code.

#### Redux Toolkit includes:
!. `configureStore()` function with simplified configuration options. It can automatically combine your slice reducers, adds whatever Redux middleware you supply, includes redux-thunk by default, and enables use of the Redux DevTools Extension.

2. `createReducer()` utility that lets you supply a lookup table of action types to case reducer functions, rather than writing switch statements.

3. `createAction()` utility that returns an action creator function for the given action type string. The function itself has toString() defined, so that it can be used in place of the type constant.

4. `createSlice()` function that accepts a set of reducer functions, a slice name, and an initial state value, and automatically generates a slice reducer with corresponding action creators and action types.

5. createSelector utility from the Reselect library, re-exported for ease of use
