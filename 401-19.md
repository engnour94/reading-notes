# AWS:Event

## Q
1. **Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server**

 AWS you can separate the routing process and the function handler, where you send the HTTP request using AWS API Gateway and integrate them with Lambda functions as they will be triggered when a specific route been hit, and all this process will be serverless (using AWS cloud as a server for your app). while In Express server you connect and send HTTP requests to specific endpoints and connect them with handler functions on the same server .
also Both have routes, and the lambda function acts like a middleware or an endpoint function in Express
1. **List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each**

* **AWS Dynamo** is more useful for extract transform load (ETL) data warehouse scenarios than for online or ad hoc queries. S3 also comes with services that allow for the querying of structured data within S3. However, this is slow compared to relational databases and S3. is a No-SQL database allow you to store data and manipulate it, also it has a package called Dynamoose will allow you to connect with DynamoDB more easily.

* **AWS S3**  Simple Storage service, allow you to store specific issues or maybe back-up your data for later time. DynamoDB clearly understands the contents of items, and users can set up indexes to help them query the properties of items efficiently.

1. **What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?**
* **standard queue**: It’s the default queue type offered by AWS SQS. This provides unlimited throughput, best effort ordering and at least once message delivery.

* **FIFO Queue**: FIFO means first in first out. Which simply means that messages will be ordered in the queue and first message to arrive in the queue will be first to leave the queue.

1. **How can the server be assured a message was properly received?**

by hit an event after receiving a message



## vocabulary terms
* `**Serverless API**`: routes and lambda functions for microservices that do not require their own dedicated servers
* `**Triggers**`: special type of stored procedure that automatically runs when an event occurs in the database server. DML triggers run when a user tries to modify data through a data manipulation language (DML) event. DML events are INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements on a table or view


* `**Dynamo vs Mongo**`:
MongoDB : is vendor agnostic, Open Source, and can be deployed anywhere. DynamoDB is only available on AWS. DynamoDB is a fully managed AWS service, MongoDB can be self installed or fully managed with MongoDB Atlas.

 DynamoDB as an integrated AWS service makes it easier to develop end to end solutions. DynamoDB uses tables, items and attributes, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents. DynamoDB supports limited data types and smaller item sizes; MongoDB supports more data types and has fewer size restrictions.
* `**Dynamoose vs Mongoose**`:
Dynamoose is a DynamoDB API structured like Mongoose, lets us provide a schema and perform CRUD operations against a DynamoDB table, installed via node and configured based on role




## Preparation Materials

### AWS provides 2 different means of providing inter-application messaging

* **SNS** - Simple Notification Service
* **SQS** - Simple Queue Service

### The differences between SNS and SQS
**Entity Type**
* SQS : Queue (similar to JMS, MSMQ).
* SNS : Topic-Subscriber (Pub/Sub system).
<br>
**Message consumption**
<br>

* SQS : Pull Mechanism — Consumers poll messages from SQS.
* SNS : Push Mechanism — SNS pushes messages to consumers.
* 
<br>

**Persistence**
<br>
* SQS : Messages are persisted for some duration is no consumer available. The retention period value is from 1 minute to 14 days. The default is 4 days.
* SNS : No persistence. Whichever consumer is present at the time of message arrival, get the message and the message is deleted. If no consumers available then the message is lost.
In SQS the message delivery is guaranteed but in SNS it is not.

<br>

**Consumer Type**
<br>
* SQS : All the consumers are supposed to be identical and hence process the messages in exact same way.
* SNS : All the consumers are (supposed to be) processing the messages in different ways.

### Use Cases
**Choose `SNS` if:**
* publish and consume batches of messages.
* allow same message to be processed in multiple ways.
* Multiple subscribers are needed.
**Choose `SQS` if:**
* You need a simple queue with no particular additional requirements.
* Decoupling two applications and allowing parallel asynchronous processing.
* Only one subscriber is needed.
---
* We can design fanout pattern by using both SNS and SQS. In this pattern, a message published to an SNS topic is distributed to multiple SQS queues in parallel
