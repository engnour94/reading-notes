# AWS: Cloud Servers

## Q

1.  **Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle**

- Browser(client) makes a request
- Request is received by the server
- Server processes the request, sends back a response to the browser(client)and so on

1.  **Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC**
A web server is hardware or software through which a computer can host a website. A server can be hosted in kernel mode or user mode; kernel mode has the web server run on top of the operating system, while user mode (downloaded just like another app or program) is slower and less effective. Just one example of a well-known web server is Apache, which runs well on a variety of popular operating systems.

Web servers communicate with clients (those who are accessing their hosted websites) through the Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol. Typically web servers are programmed to allow a certain amount of traffic, or a certain number of requests, for a period of time. This is set to protect the server from being overloaded, which in some cases can temporarily make it inoperable.

1.  **What does it mean to “deploy” an application?**
Application Deployment (also referred to as Software Deployment) is the process of installing, configuring, and enabling a specific application or set of applications, usually through an application manager (app manager) or software management system, to a specific URL on a server. Once the process of deploying the application(s) has been completed it becomes publicly accessible on the URL.



## Vocabulary Terms

* **Server**
A server is simply a program (lines of code)
It provides a service or functionality for another program or user (client)
It could also mean the hardware (computer) that is dedicated to house the server program
* **Pub/Sub**
A publisher application creates and sends messages to a topic. Subscriber applications create a subscription to a topic to receive messages from it. Communication can be one-to-many (fan-out), many-to-one (fan-in), and many-to-many, as the following diagram shows.

* **WRRC**
Web-Request-Response-Cycle is a cycle that show the flow of data when a user or server make request to specific site then this request will go to the ISP (internet service provider) to check the DNS (Domain name server, which is basically a lot of IP addresses) and find to you the IP address of the server you are requesting then send request to that server and that server will check this request and check the databases then back with a response to your ISP and back to you with the final results



## Preparation Materials

### Amazon EC2
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.
### Amazon EC2 provides the following features:
* Virtual computing environments, known as instances

* Preconfigured templates for your instances, known as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), that package the bits you need for your server (including the operating system and additional software)

* Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for your instances, known as instance types

* Secure login information for your instances using key pairs (AWS stores the public key, and you store the private key in a secure place)

* Storage volumes for temporary data that's deleted when you stop, hibernate, or terminate your instance, known as instance store volumes

* Persistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), known as Amazon EBS volumes

* Multiple physical locations for your resources, such as instances and Amazon EBS volumes, known as Regions and Availability Zones

* A firewall that enables you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach your instances using security groups

* Static IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing, known as Elastic IP addresses

* Metadata, known as tags, that you can create and assign to your Amazon EC2 resources

* Virtual networks you can create that are logically isolated from the rest of the AWS Cloud, and that you can optionally connect to your own network, known as virtual private clouds (VPCs)
