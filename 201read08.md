CSS Layout
Ways to position elemnets — positioning schemes:
* *ormal flow
* relative positioning
* absolute positioning
* floats

**Building Blocks:**
* block-level
start on a new line
block-level elements:
`<h1> , <p> , <ul> , <li> `
* inline box
flow between text
inline box elements:
`<img> , <b> , <i>`

**Box offset properties — to indicate where a box shoud be positioned:**
* fixed positioning absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window
elements with fixed positioning do not affect the position of surrounding elements and they do not move when the user scrolls up or down the page

* floating elements floating elements take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box
the floated element becomes a block-level element around which other content can flow

* z-index hen you move any element from normal flow, boxes can overlap
z-index property allows you to control which box appears on top

**Normal flow:**
position : static
**Relative positioning:**
position : relative
**Absolute positioning:**
position : absolute
**Fixed positioning:**
position : fixed



## Summary Layout
A website is often divided into headers, menus
content and a footer:

* A header is usually located at the top of the website (or right below a top navigation menu). It often contains a logo or the website name
* `<div>` elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
* The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
*  Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
