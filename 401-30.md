# Application State with Redux


## Q

1. **What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”**
- Cookies  have an expiry date, unlike local storage
- Cookies are automatically saved, sent and removed by the browser.
-  cookies can be accessed  from both the back-end (req.headers.cookie) and front-end  but the local storage Data is only accessed from the local browser. Server can't access local storage unless a request been send (POST or GET)
- Cookies have 4094 byte per cookie but local storage 5 MB per domain

1. **Explain 3rd party cookies.**
 are cookies that are set by a website other than the only you are currently on. For example, a "Like" button on a website which will store a cookie on a visitor's computer, that cookie can later be accessed by Facebook to identify visitors and see which websites were visited. Such a cookie is considered to be a 3rd party cookie

1. **How do pixel tags work?**
A 1x1 pixel (image) that is loaded when someone opens a website or opens an email, but the pixel is not served from the website's domain, but from the ad server's domain.

- Everything that changes in an app is stored in a single object
- Action allows for changes to Redux
- State is redundant
- Redux functions must be pure
- Function must take in previous state and return the new state

- it's used for application state management with React
- Redux is a tank state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments and are easy to test. While it's mostly used as a state management tool
-  can be used it with any other JavaScript framework or library
- React Redux provides APIs that allow your components to dispatch actions and subscribe to data updates from the store.

- **how to start**
- create store as we create context
- pass store and context to provider
