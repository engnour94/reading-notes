# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Q
1. **Describe “The Cloud”**
refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.

2. **What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?**
The main idea behind containers is that the application inside of each container has all the resources that it requires to function within the same container. This means that you can drop the container on any container host, and all the application’s requirements will still be met because those requirements (.NET, for example) move with the application inside the container.

1. **What is auto-scaling?**
Dynamically adjusting the amount of computational resources in a server farm - typically measured by the number of active servers - automatically based on the load on the farm.

1. **What is bandwidth?**
It is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path. Bandwidth may be characterized as network bandwidth, data bandwidth, or digital bandwidth.

1. **How do cloud providers compute service costs?**

When setting price, cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud

## Vocabulary terms :

* **Server Instances**: A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based. The instances are not linked with each other and can be controlled or managed separately.

* **Containers**: Put simply, a container consists of an entire runtime environment: an application, plus all its dependencies, libraries and other binaries, and configuration files needed to run it, bundled into one package. By containerizing the application platform and its dependencies, differences in OS distributions and underlying infrastructure are abstracted away

* **Cloud Services**: Computing/storage services offered online/remotely.
* **Cloud Architecture**: Cloud Architecture refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems.
* **AWS**: Amazon Web Services (cloud services)
* **EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku**:  EC2/Beanstalk is an Infrastructure as a Service product (IaaS), while Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) product.Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Heroku are two commonly used cloud services that let us deploy, monitor, and scale web and mobile apps.
Both services provide us with cloud computing resources and are great for hosting applications.

## Preparation Materials

### Amazon S3:
Amazon Simple Storage Service is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics.

### AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code as a ZIP file or container image, and Lambda automatically and precisely allocates compute execution power and runs your code based on the incoming request or event, for any scale of traffic. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from over 200 AWS services and SaaS applications or call it directly from any web or mobile app. You can write Lambda functions in your favorite language (Node.js, Python, Go, Java, and more) and use both serverless and container tools, such as AWS SAM or Docker CLI, to build, test, and deploy your functions.

#### Benefits :
* No servers to manage
* Continuous scaling
* Cost optimized with millisecond metering
* Consistent performance at any scale

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.
