## Flexbox
### Flexbox Layout
* Flexbox Layout provides a way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container efficiently, even when their sizes are dynamic

* It gives the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space

* Flexbox layout is more flexible that other layouts because it's independent of direction (vertical-base and horizontal-base)

* Flexbox layout is most appropriate for small-scale layouts, while Grid layout is for large-scale layouts

### Flexbox Basics
* Flexbox is a CSS module including a set of properties

* flex container is a parent element, which the flebox properties are set on

* flex items are children elements which flexbox properties are set on

* flex layout is based on flex-flow directions, rather than on block and inline flow directions as regular layout



### Properties used with the flex container:
* display
* flex-direction
* flex-wrap
* flex-flow
* align-content
* align-items
### Properties used with the flex items:
* order
* flex-grow
* flex-shrink
* flex-basis
* flex
* align-self and information about each one
