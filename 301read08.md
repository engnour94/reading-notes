## Introduction to SQL
Welcome to SQLBolt, a series of interactive lessons and exercises designed to help you quickly learn SQL right in your browser.

## What is SQL?
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

* To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries. A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned
* Think of a table in SQL as a type of an entity, each row in that table is a specific instance of that type. This means that the columns would then represent the common properties shared by all instances of that entity.
* Given a table of data, the most basic query we could write would be one that selects for a couple columns (properties) of the table with all the rows (instances) ex: SELECT column, another_column, ... FROM mytable;
* The result of this query will be a two-dimensional set of rows and columns, effectively a copy of the table but only with the columns we requested. If you wanted to retrieve absolutely all the columns of data from a table, we use (*) shorthand instead of listing individually. ex: Select * FROM mytable; this is a simple way to inspect a table by dumping all the data at once.

## Queries with constraints:
* In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a WHERE clause in the query. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.

* More complex clauses can be constructed together by joining numerous AND or OR logical keywords.
* Useful Operators:
Operator: =, !=, < <=, >, >= Condition: Standard numerical operators Ex: col_name != 4
Operator: BETWEEN … AND … Condition: Number is within range of two values (inclusive) Ex: col_name BETWEEN 1.5 AND 10.5
Operator: NOT BETWEEN ... AND ... Condition: Number is not within range of two values (inclusive) Ex: col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10
Operator: IN (...) Condition: number exists in a list Ex: col_name IN (2, 4, 6)
Operator: NOT IN (...) Condition: Number does not exist in a list Ex: col_name NOT IN (1, 3, 5)
* In addition to making results more manageable to understand writing clauses to constrain the set of rows returned also allows the query to run faster due to the reduction of unnecessary data being returned.
