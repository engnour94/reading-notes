# Database normalization

is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included. Take a spreadsheet containing the information as an example, where the data contains salespeople and customers serving several purposes:

* Identify salespeople in your organization
* List all customers your company calls upon to sell a product
* Identify which salespeople call on specific customers.


To achieve these objectives, we’ll use some established rules. As you apply these rules, new tables are formed. The progression from unruly to optimized passes through several normal forms.

### The first thing to notice is this table serves many purposes including:

* Identifying the organization’s salespeople
* Listing the sales offices and phone numbers
* Associating a salesperson with an sales office
* Showing each salesperson’s customers

As a DBA this raises a red flag.  In general I like to see tables that have one purpose.  Having the table serve many purposes introduces many of the challenges; namely, data duplication, data update issues, and increased effort to query data.

### Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies

Notice that for each SalesPerson we have listed both the SalesOffice and OfficeNumber. There are duplicate salesperson data. Duplicated information presents two problems:

1. It increases storage and decrease performance.
2. It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.


## Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies

* Duplicated information presents two problems: it increases storage and decrease performance and it becomes more difficulty to maintain data changes.

* These situations are modification anomalies. Data normalization fixes them. Three modification anomalies
* The forms are progressive, meaning that to qualify for 3rd normal form a table must first satisfy the rules for 2nd normal form, and 2nd normal form must adhere to those for 1st normal form. Before we discuss the various forms and rules in detail, let’s summarize the various forms:

* First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values.
 
* There are no repeating groups of columns.

* Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.

* Third Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
