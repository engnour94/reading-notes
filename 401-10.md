# Stacks and Queues

## What is a Stack?

A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

 
 a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:


* `push`, which adds an element to the collection, and
* `pop`, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.


The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack. The name "stack" for this type of structure comes from the analogy to a set of physical items stacked on top of each other, which makes it easy to take an item off the top of the stack, while getting to an item deeper in the stack may require taking off multiple other items first.

### Methods on stack:

- Push --> to put nodes O(1)

```
  push(value)
     // INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally
     // OUTPUT <-- none
     node = new Node(value)
     node.next <-- Top
     top <-- Node
```


- Pop --> to remove nodes O(1)

```
 pop()
// INPUT <-- No input
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   Node temp <-- top
   top <-- top.next
   temp.next <-- null
   return temp.value
```


- Peek --> to view the value of the top in the stack O(1)

```
 peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   return top.value
```


- isEmpty --> return true if the stack is empty O(1)

```
 isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return top = NULL
```


## Queue

In computer science, a queue is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principle (or only) operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position, known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the front terminal position, known as dequeue. This makes the queue a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. This is equivalent to the requirement that once a new element is added, all elements that were added before have to be removed before the new element can be removed. Often a peek or front operation is also entered, returning the value of the front element without dequeuing it. A queue is an example of a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection.

### Common terminology for a queue is:

* Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
* Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
* Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
* Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
* Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
* IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.



### Methods on Queue:

Enqueue --> to add nodes to the rear of the queue O(1)

```
 enqueue(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add to queue (will be wrapped in Node internally)
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   rear.next <-- node
   rear <-- node
```


Dequeue --> to remove nodes form the front of the queue O(1) 

```
dequeue()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the removed Node
// EXCEPTION if queue is empty

   Node temp <-- front
   front <-- front.next
   temp.next <-- null

   return temp.value
```

Peek --> to check the value of the front in the queue O(1)

```
 peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the front Node in Queue
// EXCEPTION if Queue is empty

   return front.value
```


isEmpty --> to check if the queue is empty O(1)

```
 isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return front = NULL
```
