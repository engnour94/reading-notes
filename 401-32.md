## Q
1. **How granular should your reducers be?**It is difficult to manage states that are deeply nested, so more reducers is better than only a few. Redux gives us combineReducers to let us define more precisely what our initial state will look like.
1. **Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched**It depends on the execution (implementation), it can cause errors if written poorly, or can result in clean firm code if done with caution
1. **Name a strategy for preventing the above** thunk middleware in redux that lets you write async logic that interacts with the store

## Terms

* **store** is an immutable object tree in Redux. A store is a state container which holds the application's state. Redux can have only a single store in your application. Whenever a store is created in Redux, you need to specify the reducer.

* **combined reducers**Helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.

## Preparation Materials

 **A "side effect" is any change to state or behavior that can be seen outside of returning a value from a function.**

* Logging a value to the console
* Saving a file
* Setting an async timer
* Making an AJAX HTTP request
* Modifying some state that exists outside of a function, or mutating arguments to a function
* Generating random numbers or unique random IDs (such as Math.random() or Date.now())

### What’s a thunk?!
* A thunk is a function that wraps an expression to delay its evaluation.
* Redux Thunk is middleware that allows you to return functions, rather than just actions, within Redux. This allows for delayed actions, including working with promises.
* Redux Thunk allows us to dispatch those actions asynchronously and resolve each promise that gets returned.
