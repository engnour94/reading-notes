## EXPRESSIONS

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.

•	EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
•	EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE

## OPERATORS
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
•	ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS Assign a value to a variable
•	COMPARISON OPERATORS Compare two values and return true or false
•	LOGICAL OPERATORS Combine expressions and return true or false
•	STRING OPERATORS Combine two strings, There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.

## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)
