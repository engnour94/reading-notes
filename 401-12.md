## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?

To allow easy maintenance and more scalability on the applications data. Packet-based networks not only enable new innovations, services, and business opportunities, they are also the most cost-effective, efficient, and scalable networks for content delivery.


2. UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
No connection needs to be established between the source and destination before you transmit data.

3. Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
Yes it can.
4. Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?
 No, a server socket listens on a one port.

5. Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?

From what I understand, the socket server (ServerSocket) is the class that listens to connections on a certain port, while a socket connection is a class that connects to an already listening socket... so I'm not sure how an application can do both at the same time  but it might not be impossible

## Vocabulary Terms

* **Observer Pattern** : Observer is a behavioral pattern which means that is concerned about communication between objects.
* **Listener** : is a function who listen to specific action to be triggered, then fire a call back function.
* **Event Handler**: a function that runs when a specific event fires
* **Event Driven Programming** :
* **Event Loop** : It is a construct that allows JavaScript and Node.js to perform non-blocking operations, it handles the synchronous script on a single thread, while leaving async code to be handled separately off the single thread, then adds it back to the call stack once it returns giving the impression of a multi-threaded language. Or, async code can be awaited, giving it the impression of synchronous code.

* **Event Queue** : An event queue is a repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system. Event queues are often used in the context of an enterprise messaging system

* **Call Stack** : A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

* **Emit/Raise/Trigger** : in event-driven programming, emit sends a message to trigger a response and raise an event
* **Subscribe** : waiting for a published event to take place
* **database** : A local or cloud-based storage system.there are two main types of the databases 1. SQL database (relational) 2. NoSql database.

## Preparation Materials

### The OSI Networking Model
The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterises and standardises the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard communication protocols.

**Web Sockets**
- Computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection
- WebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade header to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol
- WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server with lower overhead than half-duplex alternatives such as HTTP polling, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server
- Can be done by providing a standardized way for the server to send content to the client without being first requested by the client, and allowing messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open

### Layer architecture - OSI Model

| # | Layer | Protocol Data Unit | Function | Examples |
| --- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 7 | Application | Data | Height Level APIs | HTTP, IMAP, POP, SSH |
| 6 | Presentation | Data | Data translating, including encryption, character encoding, and compression | Strings encoded with null terminated strings vs Strings defined by an Integer Length |
| 5 | Session | Data | Manages a session though passing data back and fourth | NetBios and Remote Procedure Protocol (RPC) |
| 4 | **Transport** | Segment / Datagram | Reliable transmission of data between points on a network | TCP and UDP |
| 3 | Network | Packet | Managing the network through addressing, routing, and traffic control | IP and ICMP
| 2 | Data Link | Frame | Reliable transmission of frames between to physical layer nodes | Ethernet and IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN |
| 1 | Physical | bit | transmission and reception of raw data streams over a physical medium | USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet physical layer, SMB, Telephone network modem |

### TCP
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is widely used by application layer protocols in the Internet Protocol Suite. TCP creates a two way communication between two hosts and provides reliable, ordered, and error checked byte streams between the applications. TCP data transfers manage network congestion and use flow control to limit the rate a sender transfers data to guarantee reliable delivery. Each IP packet between the hosts carries a single TCP Segment. A TCP segment is made up of header and data sections.
