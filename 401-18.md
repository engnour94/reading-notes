#  AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## Q
1. **What are serverless functions?**
 serverless function is a bundle of code that you upload to a serverless provider (such as AWS or Google). This code can be configured to respond to requests via a URL, run on a schedule (that is, via a cron job), or called from other services or serverless functions.
Serverless functions are ideal for adding a dash of backend functionality to frontend applications without the complexity and cost of running a full server

1. **If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?**
writing the serverless function then use a platform that allow this service 

1. **Describe how a CDN works**
A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos. The popularity of CDN services continues to grow, and today the majority of web traffic is served through CDNs, including traffic from major sites like Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon.

## Terms

* **Serverless Functions**:  serverless function is a bundle of code that you upload to a serverless provider (such as AWS or Google). This code can be configured to respond to requests via a URL, run on a schedule (that is, via a cron job), or called from other services or serverless functions.

* **Cloud Storage**: It is storage model Over internet where data is stored on multiple virtual servers, rather than being hosted on a specific server.

* **CDN**: Content Delivery Network make a copy of the the content server and separate it to different locations around the world, when a user hit that server instead of going to that server it would send him to the closest server (CDN) to him, that process will make access to the content faster.

## Preparation Materials

## Amazon API Gateway
 is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

API Gateway sits between the backend services of your API and your APIâ€™s users, handling the HTTP requests to your API endpoints and routing them to the correct backends. It provides a set of tools that help you manage your API definitions and the mappings between endpoints and their respective backend services.
* Many AWS services support integration with Amazon API Gateway, including:
    * **AWS Lambda:** run Lambda functions to generate HTTP API responses.
    * **AWS SNS:** publish SNS notifications when an HTTP API endpoint is accessed.
    *  **Amazon Cognito:** provide authentication and authorization for your HTTP APIs.

 ### How API Gateway Works

### Benefits
* Efficient API development
* Performance at any scale
* Cost savings at scale
* Easy monitoring
* Flexible security controls
* RESTful API options

## DynamoDB
DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers:

* reliable performance even as it scales;
* a managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries;
* a small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.
### Benefits:
- Performance at scale
- No servers to manage
- Enterprise ready
