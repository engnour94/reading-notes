# Event Driven Architecture

# Q

1. **What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?** FIFO is a data flow way in wish the first in data will be the first out. queue --> is a data structure that following the FIFO flow of data approach and it has additional methods for checking the front value peek() or checking if the queue is empty or not isEmpty()

1. **How can the server be assured a message was properly received?**
Include a nonce with each sent message and the client sends a confirmation message that they received successfully

1. **What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?**
through adding a message queue into our server that will be listening to received event for example from the client side, and when that event emitted from the client it will delete the request from the queue in the server.
1. **How do you test an event driven system?**
 by manually emitting simulating user/server behavior.

## Vocabulary Terms
* **FIFO Queue**:  FIFO (an acronym for first in, first out) is a method for organising the manipulation of a data structure (often, specifically a data buffer) where the oldest (first) entry, or "head" of the queue, is processed first.

Such processing is analogous to servicing people in a queue area on a first-come, first-served (FCFS) basis, i.e. in the same sequence in which they arrive at the queue's tail.

* **Pub/Sub**: Pub/Sub is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that produce events from services that process events.

## Preparation Materials

### SNS vs SQS 

SQS and SNS are important components for scalable, large scale, distributed, cloud-based applications:
* SNS is a distributed publish-subscribe service.
* SQS is distributed queuing service.

### SNS (Simple Notification Service)

Amazon SNS is a fast, flexible, fully managed push notification service that lets you send individual messages or to bulk messages to large numbers of recipients. Amazon SNS makes it simple and cost effective to send push notifications to mobile device users, email recipients or even send messages to other distributed services.


### SQS (Simple Queue Service)

![k](https://miro.medium.com/max/1700/1*7eL3udb6Cto4I9Ly1sN8oA.jpeg)

SQS is distributed queuing system. Messages are not pushed to receivers. Receivers have to poll SQS to receive messages. Messages can’t be received by multiple receivers at the same time. Any one receiver can receive a message, process and delete it. Other receivers do not receive the same message later.

### Key Differences:
**Entity Type**
- SQS : Queue (similar to JMS, MSMQ).
- SNS : Topic-Subscriber (Pub/Sub system).
**Message consumption**
* SQS : Pull Mechanism — Consumers poll messages from SQS.
* SNS : Push Mechanism — SNS pushes messages to consumers.
**Persistence**
* SQS : Messages are persisted for some duration is no consumer available. The retention period value is from 1 minute to 14 days. The default is 4 days.
* SNS : No persistence. Whichever consumer is present at the time of message arrival, get the message and the message is deleted. If no consumers available then the message is lost.
In SQS the message delivery is guaranteed but in SNS it is not.
**Consumer Type**
* SQS : All the consumers are supposed to be identical and hence process the messages in exact same way.
* SNS : All the consumers are (supposed to be) processing the messages in different ways.

## Use Cases
* **Choose SNS if:**
You would like to be able to publish and consume batches of messages.
You would like to allow same message to be processed in multiple ways.
Multiple subscribers are needed.
* **Choose SQS if:**
You need a simple queue with no particular additional requirements.
Decoupling two applications and allowing parallel asynchronous processing.
Only one subscriber is needed.
