# Express REST API

## Questions

**1. Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware?**
1. Using methodOverride to utilize put and delete methods instead of post.
2. error handling
3. check if the users logged in before showing their data

**2.True or false: The route handler is middleware?**
False 

**3. In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?**
Through sending a response and not using next();... or by passing a parameter in next() which will use an error handler.

**4. At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?**
it will inject whenever a request to the server has been made
**5. What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”**
This happens when a server tries to send more than one response to the client per one request

## Documentation


**Middleware**
A middleware is basically a function that will receive the Request and Response objects, giving the ability to process or edit them.

**Request Object**
Represents the information in the HTTP request from the client to the server.

**Response Object**
 The response object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request.

 **Application Middleware**
 is a software that handle the gaps between the route and the route handlers to provide right data, we identify it by app.use and it is one type of the general MiddleWares.

**Routing Middleware**
Router-level middleware works in the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of express.Router().

**Test Driven Development**
 Router-level middleware works in the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of express.Router().
 
 **Behavioral Testing**
 it is part of (TDD) in which we provide human-readable description to the program tests so other users can follow it and implement the steps.

## Preparation Materials

**Classes**
Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.

**Routing**
Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. For an introduction to routing, see Basic routing.

You define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, app.get() to handle GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests. For a full list, see app.METHOD. You can also use app.all() to handle all HTTP methods and app.use() to specify middleware as the callback function (See Using middleware for details).
