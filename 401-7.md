# Bearer Authorization

## Questions

1. Write the following steps in the correct order:
- Receive access token
- Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
- Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
- Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
- Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
- Receive authorization code
- Make a request to the access token endpoint

**Answer**:
- Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
- Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
- Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
- Make a request to the third-party API endpoint
- Receive authorization code
- Make a request to the access token endpoint
- Receive access token

2. What can you do with an authorization code?

The authorization code is a temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token. The code itself is obtained from the authorization server where the user gets a chance to see what information the client is requesting, and approve or deny the request.

3. What can you do with an access token?

Access tokens are used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access an API. The application receives an access token after a user successfully authenticates and authorizes access, then passes the access token as a credential when it calls the target API. The passed token informs the API that the bearer of the token has been authorized to access the API and perform specific actions specified by the scope that was granted during authorization.

4. What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

Better security, token management provides you with a means of tracking each connected device that uses your API.

## Vocabulary Terms

- Client ID: is simple a public identifer for apps. (32-character hex string)

- Client Secret: A client secret is a secret known only to your application and the authorization server. It protects your resources by only granting tokens to authorized requestors.

- Authentication Endpoint: is a security mechanism designed to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to a given network, site or service.

- Access Token Endpoint: a key that allows you to enter protected resources.

- API Endpoint:  It is the point of entry in a communication channel when two systems are interacting. source. A route is the name you use to access the endpoint.

- Authorization Code: The authorization code is a temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token. The code itself is obtained from the authorization server where the user gets a chance to see what the information the client is requesting, and approve or deny the request.

- Access Token: the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user

## Preparation Materials

##### What is JSON Web Token?

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

##### When should you use JSON Web Tokens?
**Authorization:** This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.

**Information Exchange:** JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.

**What is the JSON Web Token structure?**
In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots `(.)`, which are:

- Header
- Payload
- Signature
