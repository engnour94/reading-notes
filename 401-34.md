## Review, Research, and Discussion
 1. **Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”**

 Ducks is a way to bundle reducers, action types, and actions into the same file. Rather than splitting up related code, it can be packaged into redux modules. (source: Medium) Redux Toolkit's goal is to help simplify common Redux use cases. It is not intended to be a complete solution for everything you might want to do with Redux, but it should make a lot of Redux-related code you need to write a lot simpler. Redux Toolkit exports several individual functions that you can use in your application, and adds in dependencies on some other packages that are commonly used with Redux
 1. **What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit**
Helps to solve three major problems with Redux: configuring a Redux store, adding numerous packages to get Redux to things, and removing unnecessary or boilerplate code.

## Terms

* **redux toolkit slices**
Helps to solve three major problems with Redux: configuring a Redux store, adding numerous packages to get Redux to things, and removing unnecessary or boilerplate code.
* **namespace**
is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it. Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions that can occur especially when your code base includes multiple libraries

## Preparation Materials

* **getting started with react native**
* open source framework for building *Android and iOS applications using React
* Views  are the building blocks of iphone and android apps
* React native allows for developing "native apps" that would otherwise be written in Kotlin or Java for Android and Swift or Obective-C for iOS
* Core components, essential ready to use native components already built and available
### Core Components and APIs
React Native provides a number of built-in Core Components ready for you to use in your app. You can find them all in the left sidebar (or menu above, if you are on a narrow screen). If you're not sure where to get started, take a look at the following categories:

* Basic Components
  Most apps will end up using one of these basic components.

    * **View**
The most fundamental component for building a UI.

    * **Text**
A component for displaying text.

    * **Image**
A component for displaying images.

    * **TextInput**
A component for inputting text into the app via a keyboard.

    * **ScrollView**
Provides a scrolling container that can host multiple components and views.

    * **StyleSheet**
Provides an abstraction layer similar to CSS stylesheets.
* User Interface
* List Views
* Android-specific
* iOS-specific
* Others
