##  Heroku Deployment

### Defining an application
An application is a collection of source code written in one of these languages, perhaps a framework, and some dependency description that instructs a build system as to which additional dependencies are needed in order to build and run the application.
Dependency mechanisms vary across languages: in Ruby you use a Gemfile, in Python a requirements.txt, in Node.js a package.json, in Java a pom.xml and so on.

The source code for the  application, together with the dependency file, should provide enough information for the Heroku platform to build your application, to produce something that can be executed.

### Knowing what to execute
* You don’t need to make many changes to an application in order to run it on Heroku. One requirement is informing the platform as to which parts of your application are runnable.

If you’re using some established framework, Heroku can figure it out. For example, in Ruby on Rails, it’s typically rails server, in Django it’s python `<app>`/manage.py runserver and in Node.js it’s the main field in package.json.

* For other applications, you may need to explicitly declare what can be executed. You do this in a text file that accompanies your source code - a Procfile. Each line declares a process type - a named command that can be executed against your built application. For example, your Procfile may look like this:

`web: java -jar lib/foobar.jar $PORT`
`queue: java -jar lib/queue-processor.jar`

* The earlier definition of an application can now be refined to include this single additional Procfile.
* Heroku is a polyglot platform – it lets you build, run and scale applications in a similar manner across all the languages – utilizing the dependencies and Procfile. The Procfile exposes an architectural aspect of your application (in the above example there are two entry points to the application) and this architecture lets you, for example, scale each part independently.
## Deploying applications
When you create an application on Heroku, it associates a new Git remote, typically named heroku, with the local Git repository for your application.

As a result, deploying code is just the familiar git push, but to the heroku remote instead:
`$ git push heroku master`
## Building applications:
When the Heroku platform receives the application source, it initiates a build of the source application. The build mechanism is typically language specific, but follows the same pattern, typically retrieving the specified dependencies, and creating any necessary assets (whether as simple as processing style sheets or as complex as compiling code).

## Tying it all together
The concepts explained here can be divided into two buckets: those that involve the development and deployment of an application, and those that involve the runtime operation of the Heroku platform and the application after it’s deployed.

The following two sections recapitulate the main components of the platform, separating them into these two buckets.
### Deploy
* Applications consist of your source code, a description of any dependencies, and a Procfile.
* Procfiles list process types - named commands that you may want executed.
* Deploying applications involves sending the application to Heroku using either Git, GitHub, or via an API.
* Buildpacks lie behind the slug compilation process. Buildpacks take your application, its dependencies, and the language runtime, and produce slugs.
* A slug is a bundle of your source, fetched dependencies, the language runtime, and compiled/generated output of the build system - ready for execution.
* Config vars contain customizable configuration data that can be changed independently of your source code. The configuration is exposed to a running application via environment variables.
* Add-ons are third party, specialized, value-added cloud services that can be easily attached to an application, extending its functionality.
* A release is a combination of a slug (your application), config vars and add-ons. Heroku maintains an append-only ledger of releases you make.

### Runtime
* Dynos are isolated, virtualized Unix containers, that provide the environment required to run an application.
* Your application’s dyno formation is the total number of currently-executing dynos, divided between the various process types you have scaled.
* The dyno manager is responsible for managing dynos across all applications running on Heroku.
Applications that use the free dyno type will sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity. Scaling to multiple web dynos, or a different dyno type, will avoid this.
* One-off Dynos are temporary dynos that run with their input/output attached to your local terminal. They’re loaded with your latest release.
Each dyno gets its own ephemeral filesystem - with a fresh copy of the most recent release. It can be used as temporary scratchpad, but changes to the filesystem are not reflected to other dynos.
* Logplex automatically collates log entries from all the running dynos of your app, as well as other components such as the routers, providing a single source of activity.
Scaling an application involves varying the number of dynos of each process type.
