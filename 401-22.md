# Component Composition

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. **Can a parent component access the state of a child component?**
<br>
  yes, In React we can access the child’s state using Refs.  we will assign a Refs for the child component in the parent component. then using Refs we can access the child’s state.
Creating Refs Refs are created using React.createRef() and attached to React elements via the ref attribute.

1. **What can be passed along in a prop variable?**

<br>
anything

1. **How can a child component “know” the state of another component?**

<br>
By communicating through a shared parent

## Terms

* **component props** r properties, can be any information, function, JavaScript that needs to be passed to another component. Can only be passed in one direction, from the root to its children, no way for data to be passed up.

* **component state**: An object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component.
* **application state**: This can refer to the storage that keeps the state of all the components of the app inside it 
In an application, state is interface between data (from backend or local change) and the representation of this data with UI elements on the front-end. State is able to keep the data of different components in sync because each state update will rerender all relevant components. State can be a medium to communicate between different components as well

## Preparation Materials

### state and lifecycle
Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.

The three phases are:

1.  `Mounting`(Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.)
 React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

    - constructor()
    - getDerivedStateFromProps()
    - render()
    - componentDidMount()
2.  `Updating` A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.

React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:

   - getDerivedStateFromProps()
   - shouldComponentUpdate()
   - render()
   - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
    - componentDidUpdate()
3. `Unmounting` when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React likes to call it.

React has only one built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted:
  - componentWillUnmount()

### components and props
* `Components` let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. 
* `Props` are arguments passed into React components.

* `Props` are passed to components via HTML attributes.
* React `Props` are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.


## props children

The React docs say that you can use props.children on components that represent ‘generic boxes’ and that ‘don’t know their children ahead of time’. For me, that didn’t really clear things up. I’m sure for some, that definition makes perfect sense but it didn’t for me.
My simple explanation of what this.props.children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.
