#  Reading: Access Control (ACL

## Review, Research, and Discussion


**1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?**

* The Basic authentication --> the authentication using a username and a secret password ( in the sign in process)
* The Bearer authentication --> the authentication using a token (after sign in process to ensure that the user still logged in)

**2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?**

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
 This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

**3. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?**

* It should be stored securely (in .env for example best kept in a .env file that is not uploaded with the rest of your code)
* It should be random, not guessable
* It should be a String

## Vocabulary Terms

* **encryption**: It is the process of encoding information... making it readable only to authorized parties

* **token**: is a piece of a two-factor authentication security device that may be used to authorize the use of computer services.

* **bearer**: Tokens are the predominant type of access token used with OAuth 2.0. A Bearer Token is an opaque string, not intended to have any meaning to clients using it. Some servers will issue tokens that are a short string of hexadecimal characters, while others may use structured tokens such as JSON Web Tokens.

* **secret**: These non-human privileged credentials are often called “secrets” and refer to a private piece of information that acts as a key to unlock protected resources or sensitive information in tools, applications, containers, DevOps and cloud-native environments.

* **JSON Web Token**:consists of three parts separated by dots - header, payload, signature

## Preparation Materials

### Role-based access control (Wikipedia)

- In computer systems security, role-based access control (RBAC) or role-based security is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users
- Can implement mandatory access control or discretionary access control
- Three primary rules are defined for RBAC:
  - Role assignment: A subject can exercise permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role
  - Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized
  - Permission authorization: A subject can exercise permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject's active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can exercise only permissions for which they are authorized

###  steps to simple role-based access control (RBAC)

1. **Inventory your systems**
Figure out what resources you have for which you need to control access

2. **Analyze your workforce and create roles**
You need to group your workforce members into roles with common access needs.  

3. **Assign people to roles**
Now that you have a list of roles and their access rights, figure out which role(s) each employee belongs in, and set their access accordingly. 

4. **Never make one-off changes**
Resist any temptation to make a one-off change for an employee with unusual needs. If you begin doing this, your RBAC system will quickly begin to unravel. Change the roles as required or add new ones when really necessary. 

5. **Audit**
Periodically review your roles, the employees assigned to them, and the access permitted for each. If you discover, for example, that a role has unnecessary access to a particular system, change the role and adjust the access level for all employees in that role.
