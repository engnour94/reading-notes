# Props and State

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. **Does a deployed React application require a server?** NO
1. **Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?**
We need to write tests for the behavior of the application, not the implementation of the behavior. Implementation can change but the behavior doesn't change that fast. By testing behavior, you won't have to adjust after each minor code change
1. **What does npm run build do?**
it used when move your app to production, having multiple JavaScript or CSS files isn’t ideal. When a user visits your site, each of your files will require an additional HTTP request, making your site slower to load. So to remedy this, you can create a “build” of our app, which merges all your CSS files into one file, and does the same with your JavaScript. This way, you minimize the number and size of files the user gets. To create this “build”, you use a “build tool”. Hence the use of npm run build.

1. **Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application**
React app is a set of component (component-Based) that change according to different states, and gather together to create the whole UI interface.

## Vocabulary Terms


* **BDD**:Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) is a synthesis and refinement of practices stemming from Test Driven Development (TDD) and Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD). BDD augments TDD and ATDD with the following tactics:

1. Apply the “Five Why’s” principle to each proposed user story, so that its purpose is clearly related to business outcomes
2. thinking “from the outside in”, in other words implement only those behaviors which contribute most directly to these business outcomes, so as to minimize waste
3. describe behaviors in a single notation which is directly accessible to domain experts, testers and developers, so as to improve communication
4. apply these techniques all the way down to the lowest levels of abstraction of the software, paying particular attention to the distribution of behavior, so that evolution remains cheap

* **Acceptance Tests**a type of testing done by users, customers, or other authorized entities to determine application/software needs and business processes. It is also known as user acceptance testing (UAT), operational acceptance testing (OAT), and end-user testing.
the testing technique performed to determine whether or not the software system has met the requirement specifications, the main purpose is to evaluate the system's compliance with the business requirements and verify if it is has met the required criteria for delivery to end-users. Forms of acceptance testing: user acceptance testing, business acceptance testing, alpha testing, beta testing.
* **mounting**:is a process by which the operating system makes files and directories on a storage device (such as hard drive, CD-ROM, or network share) available for users to access via the computer's file system
* **build**:  process of converting source code files into standalone software artifacts that can be run on a computer

## Preparation Materials
State is the term we use to talk about values that are owned by a component itself.

Unlike props, which are passed to a component from above, state is created within a component and can only be updated by that component.

### setState 
* All the React components can have a state associated with them. The state of a component can change either due to a response to an action performed by the user or an event triggered by the system. Whenever the state changes, React re-renders the component to the browser. Before updating the value of the state, we need to build an initial state setup. Once we are done with it, we use the setState() method to change the state object. It ensures that the component has been updated and calls for re-rendering of the component.

### handling events
React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase. With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

### forms
* HTML form elements work a little bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state
* In HTML, form elements such as input, textarea, and select typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input
* In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState()
* Can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.
### state and lifecycle
Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.

The three phases are:

1.  `Mounting`(Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.)
 React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

    - constructor()
    - getDerivedStateFromProps()
    - render()
    - componentDidMount()
2.  `Updating` A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.

React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:

   - getDerivedStateFromProps()
   - shouldComponentUpdate()
   - render()
   - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
    - componentDidUpdate()
3. `Unmounting` when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React likes to call it.

React has only one built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted:

### components and props
* `Components` let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. 
* `Props` are arguments passed into React components.

* `Props` are passed to components via HTML attributes.
* React `Props` are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
