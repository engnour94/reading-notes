# Message Queues

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. **What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?**
An important consequence is that you may efficiently push data from the server to the client. It must be handled both client-side and server-side. Of course that implies that both software be updated (old browsers and old servers can't handle websockets).

2. **Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?**
Yes, socket use HTTP at the beginning to initialize the connection between the server and the client then after establish connection it start using TCP. Also if the TCP fall down socket io will start using HTTP.

3. **What happens when a client emits an event?**
The event will be sent to the server, which will be listening for the event
4. **What happens when a server emits an event?**
 when client is listening for the event all, or one specific client will respond

5. **What happens if a client “misses” an event?**
 behaves as if there is no event listener for the event
6. **How can we mitigate this?**
 avoid missing an event by always having handlers installed and then deciding in the handlers whether to do anything with the message or not

## Vocabulary Terms

* **Socket**:
Is a protocol to create full dublex communication between the server and the client, so they can send and receive real time data.


<br>

* **Web Socket**:
 It is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. source

<br>

* **Socket.io** : a library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the browser and the server, consists of a Node.js server and a javascript client library for the browser

<br>

* **Client**:
A client is a connection on the frontend(users.) 

<br>

* **Server**:A system that provides services to other systems in its network.


<br>

* **OSI Model**: 
open systems interconnection model is a model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology 
7 layers: physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer, session layer, presentation layer, application layer


<br>


* **TCP Model**: The TCP/IP model consists of five layers: the application layer, transport layer, network layer, data link layer and physical layer. … TCP/IP is a hierarchical protocol made up of interactive modules, and each of them provides specific functionality.

<br>


* **TCP** : Transmission Control Protocol... simply, it is a way/protocol of making sure that sent data is received on the other end.


<br>

* **UDP**: User Datagram Protocol: is a communications protocol that is primarily used for establishing low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet. It speeds up transmissions by enabling the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the receiving party. it is suitable for streaming and gaming.

<br>

* **Packets**:
is the unit of data that is routed between an origin and a destination on the Internet or any other packet-switched network. ... As an example, e-mails and web pages will make use of network packets to send information back and forth to the user and recipients
Packets are intended to transfer data reliably and efficiently. Instead of transferring a large file as a single block of data, sending smaller packets helps ensure each section is transmitted successfully. If a packet is not received or is "dropped," only the dropped packet needs to be resent.

## Preparation Materials

`Rooms` A room is an arbitrary channel that sockets can join and leave. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients:

`Namespaces` A Namespace is a communication channel that allows you to split the logic of your application over a single shared connection (also called “multiplexing”).

### Implementing Message Queues

A Queue server runs independently, and is tasked with routing events and messaging between clients.

- Any connected client can "publish" a message into the server.
- Any connected client can "subscribe" to receive messages by type.

The Queue server has the ability to see which clients are connected,  to which Queues they are attached and further, to which events they are subscribed.

The Queue server is tasked with receiving any published message and then distributing it out to all connected and subscribed clients. It must further ensure that subscribed clients can "catch up" and pull down any messages that they might have missed during a period of disconnection with the server

- `message` -  a package of information, categorized by queue (bucket) and event name
- `queue` - a list of (bucket) of events
  - i.e. "Database Events", "Filesystem Events", "Network Events", etc
- `event` - What event has happened
  - i.e. "delete, add, update, connection lost, error", etc.
- `payload` - data associated with the event
  - i.e. "record id, record information, error text", etc.


### Socket.io Chat example
Sockets have traditionally been the solution around which most real-time chat systems are architected, providing a bi-directional communication channel between a client and a server The server can push messages to clients Whenever you write a chat message, the idea is that the server will get it and push it to all other connected clients

Rooms A room is an arbitrary channel that sockets can join and leave. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients.
