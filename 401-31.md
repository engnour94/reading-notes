#  Redux - Combined Reducers

## Q
1. **Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?**
to manage huge applications with complex state management, in a large scale application, Redux is a better way to control state.
1. **What is the purpose of a reducer?**:
The reducer takes a state and an action and returns a new state
1. **What does an action contain?**
 type property and payload
1. **Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?** it is a pure function that do not have side effect and do not change the input itself. and not affect the original state and return it by default.

## Terms


* **immutable state**State cannot be modified, reducers must make copies of existing state to make updates.
* **time travel in redux** Time travel debugging is stepping forward and backward in the state of the application to understand what is happening in the app's lifecycle
* **action creator** js object that tells the reducer how to change data it must have type property and it could have payload
* **reducer**: a pure function that returns some states (data)
* **dispatch**: connect action object with reduce function

### combineReducers(reducers)
The `combineReducers` helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.

The resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object. The state produced by `combineReducers()` namespaces the states of each reducer under their keys as passed to `combineReducers()`

* **reducer passed to combineReducers must satisfy these rules:**
* For any action that is not recognized, it must return the state given to it as the first argument.

* It must never return undefined. It is too easy to do this by mistake via an early return statement, so combineReducers throws if you do that instead of letting the error manifest itself somewhere else.

* If the state given to it is undefined, it must return the initial state for this specific reducer. According to the previous rule, the initial state must not be undefined either. It is handy to specify it with ES6 optional arguments syntax, but you can also explicitly check the first argument for being undefined.


### Using combineReducers
* **important ideas to be aware of when using combineReducers:**

* First and foremost, combineReducers is simply a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing Redux reducers. You are not required to use it in your own application, and it does not handle every possible scenario. It is entirely possible to write reducer logic without using it, and it is quite common to need to write custom reducer logic for cases that combineReducer does not handle. (See Beyond combineReducers for examples and suggestions.)

* While Redux itself is not opinionated about how your state is organized, combineReducers enforces several rules to help users avoid common errors. (See combineReducers for details.)

* One frequently asked question is whether Redux "calls all reducers" when dispatching an action. Since there really is only one root reducer function, the default answer is "no, it does not". However, combineReducers has specific behavior that does work that way. In order to assemble the new state tree, combineReducers will call each slice reducer with its current slice of state and the current action, giving the slice reducer a chance to respond and update its slice of state if needed. So, in that sense, using combineReducers does "call all reducers", or at least all of the slice reducers it is wrapping.

* You can use it at all levels of your reducer structure, not just to create the root reducer. It's very common to have multiple combined reducers in various places, which are composed together to create the root reducer.
