## Sending form data
Once the form data has been validated on the client-side, it is okay to submit the form. And, since we covered validation in the previous article, we're ready to submit

 **Client/server architecture**

* At it's most basic, the web uses a client/server architecture that can be summarized as follows. a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.

**On the client side: defining how to send the data**
The `<form>` element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are action and method.


* Method attribute defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the GET method and the POST method
* GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.
* POST method is the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.
* HTTP requests are never displayed to the user.
* If you need to send a password (or any other sensitive piece of data), never use the GET method or you risk displaying it in the URL bar, which would be very insecure.
* If you need to send a large amount of data, the POST method is preferred because some browsers limit the sizes of URLs. In addition, many servers limit the length of URLs they accept.
