# Local Storage

## DIVING IN

Historically, web applications have had none of these luxuries. Cookies were invented early in the web’s history, and indeed they can be used for persistent local storage of small amounts of data. But they have three potentially dealbreaking downsides:

* Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
* Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)
*Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data — enough to slow down your application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful

**What we really want is**
* a lot of storage space
* on the client
* that persists beyond a page refresh
* and isn’t transmitted to the server

## INTRODUCING HTML5 STORAGE

what is HTML5 Storage? Simply put, it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server (unless you go out of your way to send it manually). Unlike all previous attempts at providing persistent local storage, it is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not.

**check for HTML5 Storage**

>function supports_html5_storage() {
  try {
    return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !== null;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
}
>Instead of writing this function yourself, you can >use Modernizr to detect support for HTML5 Storage.

>if (Modernizr.localstorage) {
  // window.localStorage is available!
>} else {
  // no native support for HTML5 storage :(
  // maybe try dojox.storage or a third-party solution

## USING HTML5 STORAGE

HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats. However, the data is actually stored as a string. If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.

  getter any getItem(in DOMString key);
  setter creator void setItem(in DOMString key, in any data);

# LOCAL STORAGE FOR WEB APPLICATIONS

**Persistent  local storage is one of the factors why native client applications have held an advantage over web applications.**

**Cookies are used by web applications for persistent local storage of small amounts of data, but they have 3 main downsides**

## Downsides of Cookies: 

1. **Slowing**
    Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
2. **Sending unencrypted data**
    Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)
3. **Limited storage**
    Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data — enough to slow down your application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful

## HTML 5 Storage

**HTML5 storage is a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser.**
