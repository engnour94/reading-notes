# Hooks API

##  Q
1. **Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?**
Do not need them thanks to client-side routing libraries, react-router-dom allows to register multiple URLs and their corresponding components in one of the parent nodes of the DOM tree. Then, depending on the URL entered certain nodes are rendered to the DOM and others are not. Single-page-applications still need to get data for different components as components render. They may smaller requests for only the data (typically JSON) that is needed whereas a traditional website would request the entire HTML document again as well as the data. In React, data fetching is done inside of components with functions like componentDidMount or using React hooks
1. **If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?**
Outside the `<BrowserRouter/>`
Inside the `<BrowserRouter />`, outside a `<Route />`
Inside a `<Route />`

Answer: Inside the , outside a , because it needs to be included in the BrowserRouter, which holds everything, but it needs to be outside of routes so that they do not change or disappear no matter the chosen Route
1. **What does props.children contain?**
The React docs say that you can use props.children on components that represent ‘generic boxes’ and that ‘don’t know their children ahead of time’. For me, that didn’t really clear things up. I’m sure for some, that definition makes perfect sense but it didn’t for me.
My simple explanation of what this.props.children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.

## Terms

* **Composition** the act of combining parts or elements to form a whole, components are the UI building blocks in React applications like pure functions are the building blocks of function composition
* **Children / Child Components**  components that are nested within a parent React component (button within a form for example), within the parent components JSX tags
* **Hash Routing** A that uses the hash portion of the URL (i.e. window.location.hash) to keep your UI in sync with the URL. Used to support legacy browsers.
* **Link Routing** Provides declarative, accessible navigation around the application

## Preparation Materials

### what is Hooks?
Hooks API is a set of built-in functions that allow developers to use the state and lifecycle methods in the functional components. So, with hooks, functional components can handle UI, state, and logic of the component as well.

The good news is that hooks work with the existing code, so you don’t have to rebuild all your application to try hooks, you can do it in the new feature if you wish to try it.

### Why Hooks?

* First of all, React Hooks allow us to create highly reusable, isolated components and help us to avoid unnecessary logic.

* It’s straightforward to work with and test.

* It provides an improved way to share logic across different components.

* The code written with hooks is very often less complicated and looks cleaner.

* In Javascript, a minified function is less code than a minified class.

* Huge components that are hard to refactor and test.
* Duplicated logic between different components and lifecycle methods.
* Complex patterns like render props and higher-order components.

###  Rules of hooks

In official React documentation we can find two rules telling us about using hooks:

„Only call hooks at the top level”

This means that hooks can’t be called inside the loops, nested functions, conditions. They should be used only at the top level of the functions.

„Only call hooks from React functions”

Hooks should be called only in React functions, it’s a bad practice to all them from plain Javascript functions. In practice, it means that hooks should be called only in React functional components or inside the custom hooks.

###  Basic hooks
Now, let’s take a closer look at the actual hooks. There are three basic hooks in React.js documentation, but as I’d like to explain to you the hooks which are the most useful, we are going to take a look at just two of them: useState() and useEffect().

useState()

### Redux hooks
I’d like to write a little bit about handling redux store with hooks because it’s also possible.

There are also two important hooks for redux, and they are described pretty well in redux documentation. It’s useSelector() and useDispatch().
