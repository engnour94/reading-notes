# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

## CSS Transforms
With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

Within this lesson we’ll take a look at both two-dimensional and three-dimensional transforms. Generally speaking, browser support for the transform property isn’t great, but it is getting better every day. For the best support vendor prefixes are encouraged, however you may need to download the nightly version of Chrome to see all of these transforms in action.


This new property allows for new ways to position, size, and change elements.

The transform property can either be :

**two dimensional or**

**three dimensional**

Because the browser support for the transform property is still not great, vendor prefixes are used for best support.

Syntax:

>-vendor_prefix-transform: transform_type(amount);
transform: transform_type(amount);
the un-prefixed declaration comes last to overwrite >the prefixed versions

**2D Transforms**
define the length and width of the element to be distorted or transformed on the xy-plane.

**2D Rotate**
to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees
+ve value : rotate cw
-ve value : rotate ccw
transform: rotate(amount);
**2D Scale**
to change the appearant size of an element
the default value is 1 , which represents the element's original size
transform: scale(amount);
**3D Transforms**
define the length, width, and height of the element to be distorted or transformed on the xyz-space.

**Transitions & Animations**
Another new CSS3 properties are the transition and aniamation which allow to write the behaviors for transitions and animations without using JS.
