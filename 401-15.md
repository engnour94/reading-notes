# Trees

## Common Terminology:
* `Node` - A Tree node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes
* `Root`- The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
* `K` - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
* `Left` - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
* `Right` - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
* `Edge` - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
* `Leaf` - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
* `Height` - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

## Traversals

An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

* Depth First
* Breadth First

--- 

1. Depth First:
 is to search in depth (tree height), we rely on `recursion` (call stack)

    - Pre-order: `root` --> `left` --> `right`

2. Breadth First:
it is going through each level of the tree node-by-node. it uses Queue to traverse the width

---
##  K-ary Trees

tree that the nodes in it have more than two children (k = number of children)  

we traverse it using the same Breadth first 

---
## Binary search trees

 binary search trees (BST), sometimes called ordered or sorted binary trees, are a particular type of container: data structures that store "items" (such as numbers, names etc.) in memory. They allow fast lookup, addition and removal of items, and can be used to implement either dynamic sets of items, or lookup tables that allow finding an item by its key (e.g., finding the phone number of a person by name).

Binary search trees keep their keys in sorted order, so that lookup and other operations can use the principle of binary search: when looking for a key in a tree (or a place to insert a new key), they traverse the tree from root to leaf, making comparisons to keys stored in the nodes of the tree and deciding, on the basis of the comparison, to continue searching in the left or right subtrees. On average, this means that each comparison allows the operations to skip about half of the tree, so that each lookup, insertion or deletion takes time proportional to the logarithm of the number of items stored in the tree. This is much better than the linear time required to find items by key in an (unsorted) array, but slower than the corresponding operations on hash tables.

A binary search tree of size 9 and depth 3, with 8 at the root. The leaves are not drawn.
