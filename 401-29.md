# Graph

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges

##  Common terminology used  with Graphs:
- Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Directed vs Undirected


### Undirected Graphs: 
is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.there is two way relation so we don't care about direction

### Directed Graphs (Digraph)
A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

### complete graph
 is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes, each vertex is actually connected to every other node on the graph

 ### Connected
A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
 each node is connected to at least one other node or vertices. A Tree is a form of a connected graph.

### Disconnected
A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.some nodes may not always be connected to other nodes or vertices of the graph. It is completely possible to have standalone nodes or edges (also known as islands) in a graph data structure.

## Acyclic vs Cyclic


### Acyclic Graph
An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.A directed acyclic graph is also called a DAG. This can also be represented as what we know as a tree.

### Cyclic Graphs
A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.

A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.
