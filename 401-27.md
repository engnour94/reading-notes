# Context API

## Q

1. **Describe use cases for useMemo() and useReducer()**

* `useMemo()` is can be used to memorize the output of functions, useful for costly functions
* `useReducer()` is good for application with complex state management needs and for deep updates because it sends a dispatch instead of a callback

1. **Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?**
It's a convention, and without it react wouldn't be able to automatically check for violations of rules of hooks.

1. **What do custom hooks usually do?**
Custom hooks allow us to have cleaner functional components, remove logic from the UI layer, and prevent code duplication by bringing common use cases to reusable hooks.

1. **Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications**

- use-location hook The name says it all, this hook is used for getting the location of the browser.

1. **Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work**

It may have async functions that await to fetching data from API, it may use fetch, axios or superagent, then it handles the received data maybe be sending them to a state and use this state inside JSX.

## Term

- **reducer**:  A reducer is a function that determines changes to an application's state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change.

## Preparation Materials

* Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.
The context provider should wrap all the code that needs access to the context

* In class child components, we import {ThemeContext} and then use `<ThemeContext.Consumer>`

* In functional components, we use `useContext()`

* How does this look like in a class component??? Well, check it below and try not to laugh

* Anyway, to take this a step further, we can create a custom hook for that context and relieve the App component from managing the state


* Context API is a (kind of) new feature added in version 16.3 of React that allows one to share state across the entire app (or part of it) lightly and with ease
* Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around, it's alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on.
* Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels.
don't pass down the Avatar component itself so that the intermediate components donâ€™t need to know about the props=====> only the top-most Page component need to know
* **Benefit**
 1. make your code cleaner in many cases by reducing the amount of props you need to pass through your application 
 2. giving more control to the root components

* **Creates a Context object** ``const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue)`
* When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object it will read the current context value from the closest matching Provider above it in the tree.
* The defaultValue argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree. 
 1. ``Context.Provider`` ===> ``<MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>``
 2. ``Class.contextType``
 3. ``Context.Consumer``
 4. Context.displayName
