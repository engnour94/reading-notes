1. **Read the problem completely twice.**
`This is the single most important step.  You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times.
You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.`
2. **Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.**
`“Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!”`
3. **Optimize the manual steps.**
`It is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct and idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code.
It’s well worth the effort to try and optimize the actual solution or simplify it when it is still in the most easily malleable state.`
4. **Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.**
`What we want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.
By doing this, we can know exactly what the structure of the code we are going to write is going to look like which makes the job of filling in the actual code later trivial.`
5. **Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.**
`All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.`
6. **Optimize the real code.**
`Sometimes this step isn’t necessary, but it’s worth taking a look at your code and figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.
This is also a good place to make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names.  I cannot stress enough how important having good names for your variables and methods is for helping the person evaluating your code to understand what you were trying to do.  This is especially important when you make a mistake!`

**Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness**
If you let it, your world and the people around you will take all your time. Your time is not unlike your paycheck; if you don’t budget for things, you’ll have nothing left over by the end of the month.
This is how lives are wasted — by doing thankless work for ungrateful takers that didn’t deserve your time in the first place.

**Busyness and Stress Are the Enemy**
“People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable.” -William Irvine
Most people prize “being busy.” They proclaim it with pride, as if it’s a badge of honor.
But for most people, this “busyness” is nothing more than distraction and procrastination from what really matters. They just like feeling busy.
For world-class performers, busyness and stress are the enemy. They’re a sign you’re off-track. It means you’ve been lazy and undisciplined, and have let too many unimportant tasks take you away from what really matters.

### How to think like a programmer?

**Problem solving is the meta-skill. this is probably how you “solve” problems**

**this is the worst way to solve problem**
1. Try a solution.
2. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
3. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.
---
#### The best way involves 

a) having a framework and b) practicing it.

---
#### Steps to solve problems :
1. Understand the problem, knowing the problem is half the answer. and to do it you can (write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it (or thing… some people use a rubber duck)).

2. PLAN, do not start immediately write down or visualize the steps before starting.

3. DIVIDE, as I said before and as my note book full of this kind of notes TO DIVIDE or BREAK DOWN THE PROBLEM.

-  Break the problem into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

- Solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).

- Simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.

- Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.

- Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!

4. If still STUCK do the following (Don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!):

- Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).

- Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes.

- Research: Ahh, use your GoogleFu skills. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it.

Practice “micro problem-solving”. you can do that by playing problem solving video-games or practice code challenges (use this website https://coderbyte.com/)
Each time, a little more of the competition falls away. Until all that is left is you: the best version of you.” — Ryan Holiday

### The 5 Whys
**How to Use the 5 Whys**

1. Assemble a Team
2. Define the Problem
3. Ask the First "Why?" (here we are looking for things that actually happened not guesses (Search for answers that are grounded in fact))
Ask "Why?" Four More Times
4. Know When to Stop (You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. An appropriate counter-measure or process change should then become evident.)
5. Address the Root Cause(s)
6. Monitor Your Measures
